# HDR-Normal-Renderer
**Python** script for **Blender** to automatically generate a set of renders from an object illuminated with an **HDR**, and it's normal map.
Giving a .obj file, and a set of **.hdr** or **.exr** files containing an environmental illumination map, running this code inside Blender you can generate a specific number of renders of the object rotated randomly inside this specific illumination environment, and it's normal map.
This can be useful to generate big datasets for **Deep Learning** porpoise.
